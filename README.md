**`Programming Student (Python)`**

I'm a self-taught programming student with good knowledge of Python, creating apps with libraries like tkinter and sqlite3. I'm exited to dive deep in the Data Science field, and I love to learn about scientific programming. Some other technologies that I intend to study in the future are the Julia Programming Language, Rust, and Mojo (when it releases). I dream of creating things that can make a difference in the world, I want to improve people's lifes with code.

### 🧑‍💻 About me

I began my coding journey at the beggining of 2023, if the CS50 Harvard Course. With this course's help, I started programming in C, learned about basic Data Structures like Linked Lists and Hash Tables, and Algorithms like Binary Search and Merge Sort. But due to the classes and study routine, I wasn't able to decidade myself as much as I wanted, but since October 2023 I started coding again with a more dedicaded routine, and after November 2023 I started putting all of my efforst to study programming.
